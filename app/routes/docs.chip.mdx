Interactive compact elements for tags, filters, or selections.

## Guidelines

We have the `Chip` and `Badge` components. Here are the guidelines for using them:

- Use chips to represent tags, filters, or interactive elements.
- Use badges to represent status, counts, or static elements.

If you need a multiple tag selector, please consider using the [combobox component](/docs/combobox) for more complex use cases.

## Anatomy

Import the component and assemble its parts:

```tsx filename="Anatomy"
<Chip>
  <ChipButton />
</Chip>
```
