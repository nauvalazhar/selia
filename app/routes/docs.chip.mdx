# Chip

Interactive compact elements for tags, filters, or selections.

<DocsButtons />

<Preview name="basic" />
## Guidelines

We have the `Chip` and `Badge` components. Here are the guidelines for using them:

- Use chips to represent tags, filters, or interactive elements.
- Use badges to represent status, counts, or static elements.

If you need a multiple tag selector, please consider using the [combobox component](/docs/combobox) for more complex use cases.
