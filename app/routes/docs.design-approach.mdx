# Design Approach

How Selia components are designed to work together.

<DocsButtons />

Selia strives for visual cohesion. Components are meant to work beautifully together right out of the box, with minimal configuration required.

We achieve this through two key mechanisms:

### 1. Plain Variant

Some components include a `plain` variant that strips away visual styling like backgrounds, borders, and shadows. This allows them to be seamlessly nested inside other components without visual conflicts.

The `plain` variant can mean different things depending on the component. In `Button`, `plain` removes the background color in its normal state while adding visual emphasis on hover. However, in components like `InputGroup`, `plain` is primarily intended for composition—stripping away styling so it can be nested within other components, as we do with `Command`.

### 2. Contextual Styling

Parent components apply contextual styling to their children via `data-slot` attributes. This ensures composed components look cohesive without manual styling.

```tsx filename="selia/command.tsx"
<DialogPopup className="[&_[data-slot=input-group]]:border-b [&_[data-slot=input-group]]:px-2.5">
  {children}
</DialogPopup>
```

Not all components require the `plain` variant for composition. For example, the `Input` component within `InputGroup` automatically has its background, shadow, and border removed—because in this context, `Input` is already part of `InputGroup`'s control structure.

## Why This Approach?

We expect certain components to be frequently composed together. Rather than requiring you to add styling manually each time, we handle it by default.

### Common Composition Patterns

Here are some common examples:
<br />

**Command with InputGroup:**
```tsx filename="InputGroup in Command"
<Command>
  ...
  <InputGroup variant="plain">
    <Input placeholder="Search..." />
  </InputGroup>
  ...
</Command>
```

Here, `variant="plain"` removes `InputGroup`'s default styling, while Command applies its own contextual styling (height, padding) to match its design.
<br />

**Table in Card:**
```tsx filename="TableContainer in Card Body"
<Card>
  <CardBody>
    <TableContainer>
      ...
    </TableContainer>
  </CardBody>
</Card>
```

The `CardBody` component applies negative margins to `TableContainer` children, creating a clean edge-to-edge layout without the table being cramped by the card's padding.

<br />
**Item in Menu:**
```tsx filename="Item as MenuRadioItem"
<Menu>
  ...
  <MenuRadioItem
    render={<Item variant="plain" />}
  >
    <ItemMedia>
      <Avatar size="sm">
        <AvatarImage
          src="..."
          alt="Avatar"
        />
        <AvatarFallback>NA</AvatarFallback>
      </Avatar>
    </ItemMedia>
    <ItemContent>
      <ItemTitle>Nauval Azhar</ItemTitle>
      <ItemDescription className="text-sm">
        nauval@azhar.com
      </ItemDescription>
    </ItemContent>
  </MenuRadioItem>
  ...
</Menu>
```

The `Item` component adapts its styling when used inside `Menu`, maintaining consistent padding and hover states.
