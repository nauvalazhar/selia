# Manual Installation

Setup Selia manually by following the steps below.

<DocsButtons />

## Tailwind CSS

Before we start, make sure you have Tailwind CSS installed in your project. If you don't, you can follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).

@include "_installation-part.mdx" framework="react" cssPath="app.css" utilsPath="lib/utils.ts"

## Portals

Base UI uses portals for components that render popups, such as Dialog and Popover. 
To make portaled components always appear on top of the entire page, add the following style to your application layout root:

```tsx filename="root.tsx"
<body>
  <div className="root">
    {children}
  </div>
</body>
```

## Path Aliases

Add the `baseUrl` compiler option to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "." // [!code highlight]
  }
}
```

## Selia Configuration

Create a new file `selia.json` in the root of your project:

```json filename="selia.json"
{
  "framework": "react",
  "paths": {
    "components": "components/selia",
    "utils": "lib/utils.ts"
  },
  "imports": {
    "components": "components/selia",
    "utils": "lib/utils"
  }
}
```

@include "_component-cli.mdx"

@include "_font-icons.mdx"

## Add Component Manually

Altough the Selia CLI is the recommended way to add components to your project, you can also add them manually by following the steps below:

1. Go to the component page you want to add.
2. Open the Manual Installation tab.
3. Copy the component's source code and paste it into your codebase.
4. Update the import paths to the correct ones, for example, change `#utils` to `lib/utils.ts`.
5. If the component depends on other components, add those as well and follow the same steps.
