# Label

Text descriptions that identify and provide context for form controls.

<DocsButtons />

<Preview name="basic" />
## Guidelines

While you can use the `Field` component to group inputs and labels, the `Label` component is still useful for labeling checkboxes, radio buttons, or switches.

## Anatomy

Import the component and assemble its parts:

```tsx filename="Anatomy"
<Label />
```
