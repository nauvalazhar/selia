# Selia

Selia is an opinionated UI library for React, built on top of Tailwind CSS and Base UI. It can be used as-is, or treated as a starting point for building your own design system. It is customizable by design, but opinionated by default, so common interfaces feel structured and cohesive without constant tweaking.
